# A-simple-complaint-management-system
Students can quickly enter complaints about specific things into this simple system. For complaining, the user must submit his or her full name, ID, and department, as well as make complaints about any topic the user prefers. 

All complaints entered are added to a list container, and the user may quickly check a list of complaints indicating the user's name, id number, department, complaint id, and complaint. 

A four-digit random complaint id is generated and used to change the complaints made by the user. The user can also update or delete the complaint using the complaint id. 

This project offers one of the most straightforward complaint management systems. The goal of the project is to master some specific Python concepts without needing any SQL database connections.
